# Lessons: model display names and raw IDs

## Friendly names must never flow back into requests (#2201)

- The input bar and model picker share a display helper. Format only the name portion of GPT IDs; do not maintain a guessed catalog of models. Preserve versions, variants, and date suffixes.
- If a list item's `name` differs from its `id` (case-insensitive), treat it as an explicit alias and preserve it verbatim. An empty name falls back to the ID; non-GPT names keep their existing display behavior.
- Preserve known aliases after the list closes, too. This is temporary UI state scoped to a machine / launcher; it does not change model selection or persisted configuration.
- To decide whether a detail row needs to show the ID as well, keep comparing the raw `name` and `id`, not the friendly name. Otherwise, merely stripping a prefix creates an unnecessary second line for every GPT item.
- Search may match both the friendly name and the raw ID; selection callbacks, requests, and serialization still use the raw ID. Isolated browser verification must check menu text, the label after closing the menu, and intercepted request parameters, not just the helper's output.
- After changing a shared helper, also run the new-session tests that depend on it (#2302). Changes to `AgentModel.label` affect the fallback in `defaultModelDetail`, even if the new-session page itself is unchanged. When updating display expectations, retain request assertions for the raw model ID and effort.

If Android's existing input bar has no model list / current-model data, do not add a new query and selection flow just for a display change. Reuse the session model already passed in, and preserve the existing fallback when it is missing.
