# Native Lark image and file sending (#410)

> **Since 2026-11-04 (#1520, plugin step 3c)**: the entire Lark-gateway integration (app `/api/v1/lark/…`, Inbox and knowledge sources, Moments, assistant `ol` gate and credentials, /agent, personal Agent) is no longer in the open-source repository. It is provided by the Lark plugin (`docs/extensions/extensions.md`, `docs/plans/plan-extensions.md`, “Step 3”).
> The plugin preserves the behavior below; referenced hub source files (`hub/lark*.go`, the `internal/lark` client…) have been removed. Open-source retains official lark-cli, Lark bots, and Lark mail.

The existing `LarkChatView` composer's “＋” selects photos or files, with preview and removal before sending. Previews reuse the image viewer with pull-down dismissal and system Quick Look; messages retain native Lark formatting.

## Sending and confirmation

- Text, images, and files submit in order through one session send queue. Waiting for an echo does not block the next submission.
- Each message has a stable `client_id`. File selection saves a private snapshot; retries do not reread originals that may change or lose access. Startup cleans selection copies left by the previous process; durable media uses a separate directory excluded from cleanup.
- Successful requests save `message_id`; echoes replace local messages by `client_id` / `message_id`. Do not remove attachments based on empty text, filename, or timeout.
- Failures retain attachments for retry, restoration to composer, or deletion; leaving and reopening chat restores them. Queues isolate hub group, actual Lark account, and session.
- Quoted text still uses the main reply API; topic replies retain existing behavior. Text and attachments send separately.
- Images and files preserve quotes too (#1035): each attachment quotes the same message rather than silently sending normally. Requires hub extension capability `lark_attachment_reply`. Without it, older extensions would ignore quotes and send, so block and explain “Update the Lark Extension on Your Hub to Send Images and Files Quoting Messages”; text, attachments, quote remain in composer. Outbox stores quote, topic flag, and `threadRoot`, preserving routing on restart / retry. Topic sheets opened from a chat also select images / files (#1035 part 2), using **that chat's same durable outbox** with `thread` + `threadRoot`. Recovery, account isolation / verification remain. Chat pending rows omit topic replies; topic page displays only its own. Topic refresh reconciles against topic replies; before retry reread latest topic replies to avoid duplicates. Unknown-result files offer verification only, never reupload. Topics opened without chat outbox, or unsupported hub extension, have no attachment controls. Topic text retains original send path.

## Hub APIs

Dedicated `images` / `files` bind the configured gateway account, reuse device authentication / roles, never expose a generic write proxy. Images validate encoded size and actual MIME; files stream with Content-Length limits. Preserve gateway login-expiration codes. Old hubs require upgrade before attachment sending.
Quotes / topics (`lark_attachment_reply`): images JSON adds `reply_to` and `thread`; files query adds `reply_to` / `thread_root`. Upstream maps to images + `replyTo`, `image-uploads` + `messages/{id}/replies` with `replyMode: thread`, files + `replyTo` / threadRootId. Files bypass gateway outbox and lack idempotent retry; unknown outcomes require history checks, no automatic reupload.

## Limits and regression coverage

At most 4 attachments per batch. Photos convert to JPEG, longest edge 2560 px, strip location metadata; originals / animated images may be sent as files. Files 1 byte–100 MiB.
Normal-chat text, quotes, attachment drafts, outbox persist together (#688). Files in Application Support, excluded from backup, system file protection. Records isolated by digest of hub group / actual Lark user ID / chat; no credentials or original paths. Same-group hub address / device-token changes reuse draft; account switches use separate drafts. After initial online account verification, local drafts open offline; before sending reverify actual account using existing read-only accounts API. Failure retains content and sends no write. Legacy text / current-and-backup-address outboxes lack account identity, requiring user attribution confirmation; never auto-import across accounts. Topic replies retain original implementation.

Before send, atomically save “clear draft + add outbox”; only then clear input and request network. Persistence failure retains draft. Persist attempt marker before network. Restart marks only attempted submissions Unconfirmed Send Result; unsent queued items allow explicit retry, none automatically resend. Reconcile receipts by client_id / message_id; older messages outside latest page checked read-only by original ID, not retained forever at bottom.

Gateway file uploads do not use text / single-image outbox retry. Definitive rejection or confirmed failure to connect allows retry. Timeout, disconnect, server errors, damaged receipt offer Check Send Result / Remove Local Record only—no upload or composer restoration generating a new ID. Successful file receipt may omit message_id: retain Sent, no retry; Remove Local Record removes only phone record, not sent Lark message, and never infer echo from same filename. Client_id alone does not prove idempotent file retry. Upstream read-only send-status work is tracked in gateway issue referenced by extension instructions.

Restart recovery loads / reconciles only on opening that chat, no background bulk resend. Corrupt / newer-version state stops sending. Restore Input → confirm Clear Draft and Start Over deletes chat's local records / media and legacy recovery backups. Storage failures offer retry, not false version-incompatibility errors. Temporary selected copies release with references; durable copies cleaned after atomic new-state write.

`LarkAttachmentTests` covers snapshot isolation, size bounds, original request bytes, retry IDs, exact echoes, quote routing / account isolation, attachment quote / topic fields, capability gates, restart-preserved quote / root. `LarkAttachmentFlowTests.testQuotedPhotoFollowsWhatTheHubCanCarry` runs current / old mock (`MOCK_LARK_OLD_ATTACHMENTS=1`): preserves quote or warns / retains draft.
`LarkAttachmentFlowTests` / `LarkSendTests` use local mock hub for previews, pull-down dismissal, failure / leave / reopen, retry, text / quotes / topic replies.
Screenshots: Attachment regressions, Persistence regressions. Real accounts inspected read-only, no test messages sent.

Read-only gateway verification 2026-11-03: `GET /agent/v1/messages/{id}` for two synced messages, one own / one other, returned `item.id/feedId/isMine/localState` matching identity / chat / ID. Hub forwards fields; mock adds exact message route. No bodies / IDs / credentials recorded, no messages / read receipts sent.

Upload total budget estimated at 128 KiB/s plus one minute processing, minimum three minutes, ~14 minutes for 100 MiB; phone and hub use same budget. User cancellation propagates immediately. Gateway pending / failed local copies do not display as sent.

Text edits coalesce into disk transaction once per second; attachment changes, page exit, background save immediately. Send / restore cancel old delayed saves. Composer locks only during local commit, not network send / reconciliation / latest fetch. Disconnect hub / remove group invalidates queue / cancels tasks first, then deletes group drafts / attachments / account bindings; late HTTP / disk callbacks cannot resurrect cleaned data.

Read-only `/agent/v1/accounts` verification 2026-11-03: `activeId` / account id are strings, selected account unique, boolean `signedIn` / nonempty string userId. Match hub-request-selected account, not first primary. No real IDs / accounts / credentials recorded.
