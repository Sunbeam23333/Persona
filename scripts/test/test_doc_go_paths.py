"""Go files the current docs name by their package (`hub/deploy.go`) must exist under server/internal.

test_doc_paths.py checks paths that start with a top-level directory or with internal/. Docs often name a Go file
relative to server/internal instead, by its package (`devices/deploy.go`, `assistant/todos.go`); those were not checked,
and went stale when files moved between packages (#2448 moved hub/deploy.go, claudedirs.go, link.go and tailcat.go to
devices/). This checks every `backticked` <pkg>/<file>.go whose first part is a directory under server/internal, in the
same docs test_doc_paths.py checks and with the same skips (globs, placeholders, lines quoting another project).

A file that is not in this repository any more but is named on purpose (one that moved to an extension, a record of
an old design) is written without backticks, so it reads as a name and not as a path to open.
