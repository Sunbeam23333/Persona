// What comes in from the channels for the assistant (assistant_channels.go): the owner's messages and card presses.
// The transport took them, so none is dropped without a word: one waits for the assistant (the first seconds of a hub
// start, an assistant restarting) and is asked again when a call was cut off or timed out — the assistant takes a
// message once by its id, so asking again is safe — and only when the assistant stays away is the owner told it can't
// be reached. What the owner did is handed over with a single-use owner action: answering a card in a channel needs
// one (interactions.resolve), so the assistant can't approve a plan, allow a tool or type into a terminal by itself.
