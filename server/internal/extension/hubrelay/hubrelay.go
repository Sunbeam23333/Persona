// Package hubrelay is a manager's relay to the hub's API for its extensions (docs/assistant/managers.md "Extensions and the
// hub's API"). A manager may run anywhere and reach the hub only at its manager.json's hub, maybe across the internet
// with a key it pins, which its extensions know nothing of. So it serves them the hub's API on its own loopback and
// passes each request on with its own client: only the hub's API (/api/, no "." or ".." segment that would lead
// elsewhere), only with a live token of one of its own extensions (read as the hub reads it), as the extension sent
// it, without cookies or forwarding headers, adding only its proof that the request came through it
// (extwire.HeaderManagerProof), never a credential of its own. It logs neither the token nor the proof.
