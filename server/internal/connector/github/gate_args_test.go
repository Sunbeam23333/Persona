// is not written to, whatever the rules are and whatever the repeat is (other capitals, the very same name, a null).
// A call that spells a field once in other capitals is read by a deny or a confirm as if it were spelled right, so it
// cannot get past either; an allow does not read it (the user is asked, and the card says where the comment would go).
