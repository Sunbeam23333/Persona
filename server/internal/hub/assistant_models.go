// The model configuration is the assistant's (docs/assistant/model-config.md "Who owns models"): its records, the providers' keys, every
// model call, the routes of Settings › Model providers / Models and "New agent"'s pickers (assistantwire.Routes, relayed). The
// hub hands over what hub.json says about models (the hello) and what its plugins have (their providers, their voice
// models, which of them need info filtering), and asks the assistant only what its plugins need: whether info filtering can be
// called, which launchers have a gateway, and requests to a launcher's gateway sent with its key (models.usable,
// models.launchers, models.launcher_http).

// hubModels is what hub.json's machines say about models (their launchers), for the hello; the models themselves
// (ai, inbox's, kb's) are the manager's manager.json's.
