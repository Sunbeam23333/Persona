// The launch key (#5588): a random value the node keeps in a 0600 file beside its socket (nodeclient.LaunchKeyPath).
// A managed launcher's settings hold its provider key in plain text, and every agent's hooks and MCP servers must be
// able to reach node.sock, so being able to connect cannot be what lets a caller have them. `personad launch` reads
// the key wherever it runs: started by the node, typed into a herdr pane, run again from herdr's resume_argv after a
// herdr restart, or typed by the user in a terminal. A process that cannot read the data directory (an agent in a
// sandbox that hides it) cannot. The key stays across node restarts: a launch that read it just before one still
// gets its answer.
