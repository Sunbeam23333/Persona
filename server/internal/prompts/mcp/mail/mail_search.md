Search mail. Returns message summaries (uid, subject, from, date, snippet). Use account_id from mail_accounts; omit it to search every account's inbox at once. For Gmail the query uses Gmail search syntax (from:, subject:, has:attachment, newer_than:7d); other providers search the full text on their server. Some servers do not search at all (NetEase 163 finds nothing for any word): when the server finds nothing, subjects, senders and recipients are matched instead (every word must appear, case does not matter; bodies are not searched), a stretch of the newest mail at a time, and the result says which before_uid looks further back.
