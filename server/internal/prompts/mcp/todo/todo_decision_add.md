Note a call you made on the Persona todo you work on, so whoever picks it up next (another agent, you after compaction, the user) does not decide it again: a choice between ways of doing it, a default you settled on, something you ruled out. It shows in the todo as noted by an agent, not as the user's. Not for progress (that is report_to_supervisor) and not for what only the user can decide: ask them. To change an earlier decision an agent made, name it in supersedes_id (its id from todo_decisions); the user's own decisions you cannot replace: ask them.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["question", "choice"],
  "properties": {
    "question": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "what was to decide, in one line"
    },
    "choice": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "what you chose"
    },
    "reason": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "why, in a line or two"
    },
    "supersedes_id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "the earlier decision of this todo this one replaces"
    }
  }
}
```
