Replace a live card created by this assistant conversation with a complete validated View. Other conversations and ordinary agents cannot modify it. Supply the version read from view_get to reject stale updates; without it the hub uses the version it reads at the start of this call. Validation or a version conflict leaves the previous card intact. Contents are stored before update notifications are coalesced (at most one per second). Returns {version}. Keep stable component keys to preserve editing and scroll state across devices.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["id", "view"],
  "properties": {
    "id": {"type": "string", "description": "The exact id returned by view_show, including its view_ prefix."},
    "view": {"type": "object", "description": "The entire replacement View, including required plain-text fallback."},
    "version": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 9007199254740991, "description": "Expected version from view_get; a stale version returns a conflict instead of overwriting."}
  }
}
