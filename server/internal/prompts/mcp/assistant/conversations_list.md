List Persona's own conversations (the 对话 sidebar), newest activity first: id, title, last activity, whether it is the main conversation, whether it is running now, and the gist of its last message. Archived ones are left out unless `include_archived`. This conversation is marked. Use it to find a conversation the user means ("the one about the trip") before reading, renaming, archiving or messaging it.

    },

      "description": "also list archived conversations (marked as such)"
    },
    "limit": {
