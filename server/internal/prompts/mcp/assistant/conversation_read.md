Read the recent part of another Persona conversation (an id from conversations_list): the user's messages, what was answered, tool calls in short form, cut like agent_read. `turns` = how many recent exchanges (default 2, max 10).

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["id"],
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "full id or its first 8 characters"
    },
    "turns": {
      "type": "integer"
    }
  }
}
```
