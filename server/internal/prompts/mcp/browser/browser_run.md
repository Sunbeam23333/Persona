Drive the browser (ego lite, Chromium) on one of the user's Macs: `script` is the body of an async JavaScript function run by ego-browser, with `task` (this conversation's own task space, kept from one call to the next) and `page` (its tab p1) at hand; `return` a JSON value. The browser is the user's: sites they signed in to in ego are signed in. Page API: `await page.goto(url)`, `page.snapshot()` (accessibility text with `[ref=N]`), `page.click("@N")` / `page.fill("@N", text)` / `page.press("Enter")`, also `text=…` / CSS targets, `page.waitForURL(…)`, `page.waitForSelector(…)`, `page.title()`, `page.url()`, `page.evaluate(fn, arg)` (runs in the page), `page.keyboard.type(text)`, `page.mouse.click(x, y)`; `task.newPage()` for another tab. A screenshot of the page after the script comes back with its result. Use browser_look to read a page first. Do not clear cookies, cache or storage of the whole profile (Network.clearBrowserCookies and the like): it signs the user out everywhere. Stop and tell the user when a site asks for a sign-in, a captcha or a payment. Writes may be confirmed on the phone first, if the user set that.
