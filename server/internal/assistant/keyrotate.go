// The built-in manager's secret.key started as a copy of the hub's (managerconf.MoveFiles), so each part could open
// the other's secrets. Once its data is in its own database (owndb.go), it rotates to a key of its own, once, at its
// start, before anything of it reads a secret (docs/assistant/managers.md "Its own secret.key"):
//
//  1. Under an advisory lock in its database (two starts at once: one rotates, the other finds it done), it keeps the
//     key it has in secret.key.prev and writes a fresh one to secret.key.next-<its fingerprint>.
//  2. One transaction opens every sealed value of its database (db.ResealSecrets) with the old key, seals it with the
//     new one, and records the new key's fingerprint (sealing_key): the values and the record go together. The
//     transaction checks the record is still none, so a process whose lock was lost cannot seal over another's.
//  3. The new key's file is renamed over secret.key.
//  4. The old keys in secret.key.prev stay readable (secretkey.NewWithFallback) until nothing can still be sealed with
//     them: at least oldKeyGrace after the rotation, while no other manager process uses the database (one started
//     before may still seal with the old key), and no legacy mail file waits to be imported. That is checked every
//     minute while it runs (keepDroppingOldKey) and at each start; before the old keys go, what is still sealed with
//     them is sealed again.
//
// Every step can stop (a crash, a full disk, a lost connection) and the next start goes on from there: before the
// commit nothing is sealed with the new key; after it, the record names the new key, and the next start finishes the
// rename. A commit whose answer was lost is told by reading the record again; when that cannot be read either, the
// start stops with the new key's file kept. It touches only the manager's own directory and its own database: never
// the hub's key, nor a database that has the hub's tables.
