// botAnswerQuestion lets the owner's next plain message answer a waiting single-question card (IxQuestion,
// one question) in the same Feishu topic, like its press: channel.MatchOption reads a number, ordinal or option name
// (several for a multi-select), and interactions.resolve carries the message's one-use owner action. Words that name no
// option are, inside the card's topic, the free answer itself, submitted exactly like the card's input box and its
// Answer button (answerFromCard, free=1): a question without options is answered in words, and an option question
// takes its Other that way. In the root chat such words stay a message to the conversation, as before. Forms, plans,
// permissions and terminal dialogs take no typed answer (#4675). A message written inside another agent's topic never
// answers a card outside that topic; a message in the root chat answers the newest card anywhere. False leaves the
// message to the agent; a card no longer pending is closed, saying whether it was answered elsewhere, expired or was
// withdrawn, and the words are swallowed rather than let into a conversation. The same goes for an option typed for
// a card that already ended elsewhere and was closed (b.ended); any other message forgets such cards in its scope.
